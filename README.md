### Features
There are 5 main features you can find in this repo:
- **Feature 1**: Interactive market capitalization explorer for top 10 digital assets over time
- **Feature 2**: Correlation between #HODL, BTC, etc. searches and BTC price
- **Feature 3**: Price correlation with GPU companiesâ€™ stock price
- **Feature 4**: ICO whitepaper word exploration
- **Feature 5**: LDA topic modeling on ICO whitepapers

In addition to our 5 core features, we have considered many more views and explorations of this data. Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) with *[Experiment]* in the title were spinoffs of some features that didn't make the final cut into our product.

### Data sources
Data was scraped/downloaded via API, and CSV-downloaded from coinmarketcap.com, Google Trends, Coindesk, http://whitepaperdatabase.com/, and more
